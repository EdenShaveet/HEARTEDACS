# HEARTEDACS
*Short Description:* HEART-EDACS is a tool that automates calculation of the HEART Score (developed by Barbra Backus, MD, PhD and Alfred Jabod [AJ] Six, MD) and the EDACS (developed by Martin Than, MD, and Dylan Flaws, PhD) taking their shared inputs into consideration.

### **About the Tool**
HEART-EDACS is a tool that automates calculation of the HEART Score and the EDACS in pursuit of the following objectives:
*   Reduce time spent on manual score calculation
*   Enable greater adoption of HEART and EDACS scoring systems individually and in tandem

#### **Acknowledgements**
The [HEART Score](http://www.heartscore.nl/) was developed by Barbra Backus, MD, PhD and Alfred Jabod (AJ) Six, MD.

The [Emergency Department Assessment of Chest Pain Score (EDACS)](https://read.qxmd.com/read/24428678/development-and-validation-of-the-emergency-department-assessment-of-chest-pain-score-and-2-h-accelerated-diagnostic-protocol) was developed by Martin Than, MD, and Dylan Flaws, PhD.
